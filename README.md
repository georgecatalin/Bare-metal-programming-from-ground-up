# Embedded System Bare-Metal Programming for STM32F4xx_MCU
Bare-metal programming for the SMT32 Microcontrollers. No libraries used, only manipulation of the registries.

## Summary
The content within this repository is my own work produced as a result of completing the course  "Embedded Systems Bare-Metal Programming Ground Upâ„¢ (STM32)" , authored by Israel Gbati.
